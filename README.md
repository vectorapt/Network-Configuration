# Network-Configuration
Automated Container Deployment and Administration streamlines the process
of deploying and managing containerized applications through automation tools
like Ansible and Docker. By utilizing predefined scripts and playbooks, this
approach accelerates application delivery, reduces manual intervention, and
ensures consistency across environments. It enables efficient scaling, enhances
reliability, and fosters collaboration between development and operations
teams, facilitating the adoption of DevOps practices. Through automated
configuration management and orchestration, organizations can achieve agility,
resilience, and cost-effectiveness in their software delivery pipeline, ultimately
driving innovation and competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving digital
landscape.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the working of automation through ansible.
All the particulars of this project has been mentioned in the report committed to this repositoy.
